# hubot-happy-birthder

Hubot script for writing birthday messages to users. It uses [Tenor](https://tenor.com) GIFs to make the messages more lively.

## Features

The functionality of the script is divided into two parts: handling birthdays and work anniversaries.
- Birthdays
  * Asking new employees to specify their date birth and reminding them about it if they ignore this request for some reason.
  * Fetching a random GIF from [Tenor](https://tenor.com) before writing a birthday message to a birthday boy/girl. The `TENOR_SEARCH_TERM` environment variable stores a comma separated list of the tags which will be used when fetching GIFs. By default, the value of the variable is '[darthvaderbirthday](https://tenor.com/search/darthvaderbirthday),[futuramabirthday](https://tenor.com/search/futuramabirthday),[gameofthronesbirthday](https://tenor.com/search/gameofthronesbirthday),[harrypotterbirthday](https://tenor.com/search/harrypotterbirthday),[kingofthehillbirthday](https://tenor.com/search/kingofthehillbirthday),[lanadelreybirthday](https://tenor.com/search/lanadelreybirthday),[madhatterbirthday](https://tenor.com/search/madhatterbirthday),[pulpfictionbirthday](https://tenor.com/search/pulpfictionbirthday),[rickandmortybirthday](https://tenor.com/search/rickandmortybirthday),[rocketbirthday](https://tenor.com/search/rocketbirthday),[sheldonbirthday](https://tenor.com/search/sheldonbirthday),[simpsonbirthday](https://tenor.com/search/simpsonbirthday),[thesimpsonsbirthday](https://tenor.com/search/thesimpsonsbirthday),[tmntbirthday](https://tenor.com/search/tmntbirthday)'.
  * Writing birthday messages to `#general`.
  * Reminding users of the upcoming birthdays one day and a few days in advance. It's possible to specify how long before the event occurs the reminder should be triggered.
  * Providing fault tolerance:
    + if Tenor is for some reason unavailable right now, the script will try to request it a number of times with delays;
    + if all the requests failed, users will receive their birthday messages anyway.
  * Creating private channels in advance and inviting all the users to the channels except the birthday boys/girls for the purpose of discussing the presents for them. Expired channels are automatically removed.
- Work anniversaries
  * Memorizing the date when a new employee logs in to Rocket.Chat for the first time (the date is equal to the first working day in the company).
  * Congratulating employees on anniversary of working in the company (congratulations are written to `#general`).

## Prerequisites

* The bot must be in the channel specified via the `BIRTHDAY_LOGGING_CHANNEL` environment variable.
* The bot has to have `view-full-other-user-info` permission.

## Configuration

The script can be configured via the following environment variables (called parameters).

If the script randomly chooses a GIF from the response which belongs to the blacklist, the script sends one more request to Tenor. | [641ee5344bdc3f9f4d3ef52344dfe6bd](https://media.tenor.com/images/641ee5344bdc3f9f4d3ef52344dfe6bd/tenor.gif) |
| `TENOR_IMG_LIMIT`                   | Fetches up to the specified number of result, but not more than **50**. | 50 |
| `TENOR_SEARCH_TERM`                 | A comma separated list of tags which will be used when fetching GIFs from Tenor. | See [Features](#features) |
| `CREATE_BIRTHDAY_CHANNELS` | Specifies whether to create the birthday channels for the purpose of discussing presents for birthday boys/girls. All the users are invited to the channel except the birthday boy/girl. | false |

| `BIRTHDAY_CHANNEL_MESSAGE` | The messages separated by `\|` which are sent to the birthday channel one by one. | `@%username% is having a birthday soon, so let's discuss a present.` |
| `BIRTHDAY_CHANNEL_TTL` | Specifies TTL (time to live) of the birthday channel. | 3 |
| `BIRTHDAY_LOGGING_CHANNEL` | Allows specifying the name of the channel which is used for logging the events related to birth dates. The bot must be in the channel (see the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) sections). | hr |
| `COMPANY_NAME` | Allows specifying the company name which is used in the welcome message. | WIS Software |
| `HAPPY_REMINDER_SCHEDULER` | Allows specifying the frequency with which the script checks for nearest birthdays and writes birthday messages to users. The value of this parameter must follow the [Cron Format](https://github.com/node-schedule/node-schedule#cron-style-scheduling). | `0 0 7 * * *` |
| `HAPPY_REMINDER_SCHEDULER_MONTHLY` | Allows specifying the frequency with which the script checks for upcoming birthdays and writes reminder messages to all users. The value of this parameter must follow the [Cron Format](https://github.com/node-schedule/node-schedule#cron-style-scheduling). | '0 8 28 * *' |
| `NUMBER_OF_DAYS_IN_ADVANCE`  | Sets (in days) how long before the event occurs the reminder will be triggered. | 7 |
| `ENABLE_PITCHING_IN_SURVEY` | Specifies whether to create a pitching in survey. If the parameter is `true`, the bot asks every single user except the birthday boy/girl whether they will pitch in on a present for the birthday. | false |

## Example Interaction

```
some.user >> @hubot birthday set matt 15.02.1954
hubot >> Saving matt's birthday.
some.user >> @hubot birthday set homer 12.05.1956
hubot >> Saving homer's birthday.

hubot >> homer was born on 12.05.1956
hubot >> matt was born on 15.02.1954

## Known issues

When specifying a birth date for a particular user, the script may complain that it has never met the user before. In this case just ask the user to interact with the bot.
